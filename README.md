<h2><u>Diabetes Overview</u>: </h2>

Diabetes is a group of diseases characterized by high blood sugar. When a person has diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1) or is unable to properly use insulin (type 2). When the body does not have enough insulin or cannot use it properly, blood sugar (glucose) builds up in the blood. Pre-diabetes is a condition in which blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough to be classified as diabetes.

People with diabetes can develop high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high triglycerides (a type of fat in the blood). High blood sugar, particularly when combined with high blood pressure and high triglycerides, can lead to heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney failure, amputations of the legs and feet, and even early death.

Diabetes is also associated with increased risk of certain types of cancer, such as liver, pancreas, uterine, colon, breast, and bladder cancer. High blood sugar also increases a person’s chance of developing dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, the average medical costs for people with diagnosed diabetes are 2.3 times higher than costs for people without diabetes. These higher costs are often caused by diabetes-related health conditions and resulting hospitalizations.

People with diabetes, their caregivers and health care providers, departments of health, policy makers, and community organizations can help to reduce the risk of serious diabetes-related complications.

For people with diabetes, research shows that:

* Blood sugar management can reduce the risk of eye disease, kidney disease, and nerve disease by 40%.
* Blood pressure management can reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke by 33% to 50% and decline in kidney function by 30% to 70%.
* Cholesterol management can reduce cardiovascular complications by 20% to 50%.
* Regular eye exams and timely treatment could prevent up to 90% of diabetes-related blindness.
* Regular foot exams and patient education could prevent up to 85% of diabetes-related amputations.

### Terms:

Diagnosed - The proportion of adults age 20+ who report a previous diabetes diagnosis (age-standardized)

Undiagnosed - The proportion of adults age 20+ who do not report a previous diabetes diagnosis who have high FPG/A1C* (age-standardized)

Total - The proportion of adults age 20+ who report a previous diabetes diagnosis and/or have high FPG/A1C* (age-standardized)

Awareness - The proportion of adults age 20+ with a previous diabetes diagnosis and/or high FPG/A1C* who have received a diagnosis (age-standardized)

Control - The proportion of adults age 20+ with a previous diabetes diagnosis and/or high FGP/A1C* who currently do not have high FPG/A1C* (age-standardized)
	*High FPG/A1C is fasting plasma glucose at least 126 mg/dL and/or A1C at least 6.5%

FPG (Fasting Plasma Glucose)- Measures the levels of glucose (sugar) in the blood.

A1C test — also known as the hemoglobin A1C or HbA1c test — is a simple blood test that measures your average blood sugar levels over the past 3 months.
